What's great about FVP?
- quick to enter tasks
- accessible
- frictionless
- simple
- rewriting encourages weeding out
- seeing all tasks at once allows one to "psychologically stand out"

Negatives
- need pad/pen with you
- lists get long very quick
- lists get cluttered with things you know won't be done today
- possible for things to get lost, if you forget to rewrite an unfinished task
- rewriting is a bit laborious

Online version:
- obvious keyboard shortcuts
- simple single list
- filter by context
- defer to reappear in future
- hide irrelevant tasks (between dots)
- active tasks buttons: complete-delete, did a bit - move to bottom, undot
